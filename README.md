# Automatic EdgePi Fan System

Using the EdgePi IoT device and its python SDK, we will create an automatic cooling system.

## How it Works
Your EdgePi will be connected to a thermocouple and a DC fan. The thermocouple will continuously monitor the room temperature. The EdgePi will turn on a DC fan when the thermocouple detects a temperature that is higher than a predetermined threshold. Once the room temperature dips a few degrees below the threshold temperature, the fan will turn off.
